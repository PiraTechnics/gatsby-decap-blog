A recently released title by noted historian and Boston College Professor of History [Heather Cox Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Cox_Richardson), *Democracy Awakening* takes us on a long journey backwards and forwards in the ~250 years of the United States experiment in democratic self-governance. Clocking in at just over 300 pages, it's incredible just how much discussion, detail, and historical context Richardson manages to pack into a compelling narrative rollercoaster of our times.

Part 1 (the first third) of the book take us on a journey from the Great Depression of the 1930's and the subsequent New Deal era of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, right up to the historic election and two-term presidency of Barack Obama. Despite this section being bookended with Democratic presidents, it is the Republican party that Richardson shines the spotlight on, as she details the party's embrace of the earlier era's white supremacist southern Democracts, and their gradual takeover of the party. Many key events and people are detailed as we fly through the years: The attack on WWII veteran [Isaac Woodard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Woodard) and the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement, the establishment of the ['Liberal Consensus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States#Liberal_consensus) of the post-WWII years, The 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act, Nixon's [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy), The Reagan Revolution, the fall of the USSR, The Bush years and Neoconservatism, and finally, the Republican obstructionism of the Obama years.

The second section of the book covers the election of Donald Trump and the crystalization of the Republican Party and American Conservatism into an openly facistic, white-supremacist embracing movment. Diving into much more detail of the four years (that certainly felt like at least a decade), Richardson documents key events in the Trump presidency that swung the cultural conversation, shattered preestablished norms, and nearly resulted in the overthrow of American democracy.

The final part of *Democracy Awakening* treads historical ground once again, tying many moments and key figures (including Lincoln and the Founding Fathers) into the narratives of today. Drawing on a continuous line, Riachardson lays out the defining moments in American History, when those fighting for equal rights and protection under the law called upon the USA to fufill the promises of the Declaration of Independence. The book ends on a discussion of current events, and notes that is is up to us (as in all of us) to decide and act to write the future -- stating quite clearly, that we are in one of these defining moments once again.

Detailed, sourced, and explained in a refreshingly factual manner, Richardson's narrative lays out the descent of the Republican party from a legitimate participant in democracy to its state today, the undercurrent, ebb and flow of social progress of the past 100 years, and how it is all sown into the very fabric of the United States, down to the beginning. A thorough and compelling read from the author of the acclaimed newsletter *[Letters from an American](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/)*.

A worthwhile read for anyone yearning for a levelheaded and contextualized understanding of the times we are living through in America.
